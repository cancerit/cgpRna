======

cgpRna provides pipelines, for RNA-Seq data, that implement commonly used mapping 
and analysis programs, such as TopHat and rna-star.
At the present time (May 2016), only pipelines for mapping (with STAR), lane QC 
and fusion gene detection are included in this codebase but this will be added 
to over time with; differential expression, gene/transcript quantification, splice 
variant analysis and allele specific expression.
